Hello,

The .lua files go in dir = ~/.config/lua/nvim

This init.lua is for plugins, it goes in ~/.config/lua/nvim/plugins
  (Installing plugins - add new entries, you install them in nvim via :Lazy if it's not automatic.)
  (No manaul repo cloning needed.)

This mappings.lua is for custom keybinds it goes in ~/.config/lua/nvim
